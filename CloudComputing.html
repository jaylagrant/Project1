                <p style="text-align: left;">Amazon reports that an incorrectly typed command during a routine debugging of its billing system caused a five-hour outage of some Amazon Web Services servers. The command was meant to remove a small number of servers for one of its S3 subsystems was wrongly entered and a larger set of servers was removed. Because of this, Amazon required a full restart which took longer than assumed.</p>
                <p style="text-align: left;">Amazon representatives report that they are working on making changes in order to ensure that incorrect commands entered will not trigger an outage of its web services. Even though Amazon is known as an online retail store, Amazon has also ventured into many different avenues. They have the Echo, which is an artificial intelligence. Also Amazon is one of the world&rsquo;s largest provider of cloud services. Amazon hosts many companies&rsquo; computing functions on remote servers.&nbsp;</p>
